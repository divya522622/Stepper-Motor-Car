# Stepper-Motor-Car
Stepper Motor Car:

Introduction:

> A functioning car which has the ability to move forward and backwards and has headlights

> A breadboard which is used to be the base of the car
There are 2 stepper motors for the front 2 wheels which rotes clockwise and counter-clockwise and 2 steeper motors in the back to help align the car and help with the movement of the vehicle. 

> A button to turn the headlights (LED lights) on/off

> 2 sensors to help activate the 2 stepper motors to move forward and backward. 

Objectives:

> We have 2 functioning stepper motors to move clockwise and counter-clockwise to help mimic a cars movement. Initially we were going to have 4 functioning motors, however our launchpad has limited ports and pins so we could only do 2 motors. 

> Initially we were going to have a photoresistor to turn the LED lights on/off , but it still wasn't working so we decided to work with a button and changed the hardware to work for the switch.  

> We were having difficulty with the LED lights and wanted the lights to to turn on when pressed and then turn off when pressed again. There were many variations of the code, but ultimately we asked a friend and had searched online for some input and added a section to our program which acted as toggling function for the headlights. Finally we got the button to work and had functioning headlights.
